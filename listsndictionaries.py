# This is a program to practice using lists and dictionaries in Python

# There are 4 types of collections:
# List - ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. Use square brackets []
# Tuple - ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. Use parenthesis ()
# Set -  unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members. Use curly brackets {}
# Dictionary - unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members. Use curly brackets and colon{key:value}

# List - ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. Use square brackets []
# list elements do not all have to be the same type
mylist = [1, "red", "true", 3.14159]
print(mylist)
# list indices start at 0
print('The second element in the list is ' + mylist[1])
print(mylist[0] + mylist[3])
